Automator for Dimmy and Dummy's voting google form


This automator was made with the sole goal of voting for Paris since Dummy hates it so much. If you wanted to automate the voting process for other options you could do that with this script as well.


The automator was created based on the guidance of a tutorial[https://medium.com/swlh/automatically-filling-multiple-responses-into-a-google-form-with-selenium-and-python-176340c5220d]
